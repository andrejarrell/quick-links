# Quick Links

Quick Links was created to solve the problem of not being able to sync the bookmarks between different computers at work. It is a simple web page that allows you to store your bookmarks in a single HTML file that can be stored in a cloud storage service like OneDrive. You can set the page as your browser's home page and have access to your bookmarks from any computer.
